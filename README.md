# ds-airflow
Repository to setup DS data pipeline 

In most of the tech start-ups pipelines for Analytics and Data Science are build upon three main technologies -
1. Apache Airflow
2. Docker
3. ECS (AWS)

* Github
* AWS
* Hive
* Metabase / Any Data Visualisation Tool
* Apache Airflow

### [**Create AWS Account**](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
---
There are few reasons why I have chosen AWS
* AWS provides a easy way to create environments for Airflow (commonly referred as MWAA)
  * MWAA - Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow
* I prefer using AWS because of the community. One could mostly resolve any issue you encounter by reading online forums. I've had not-so-good experience using other cloud platforms.
* Please note this step includes giving your card details for billing

### **Create a Github Account**
---
  Github is where your code lives. You could either create an entire new account and maintain all your work/project related repositories in one place or you could use your existing account to store new repositories.
